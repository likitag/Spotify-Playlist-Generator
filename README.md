## Overview
### Description
Users can enter their musical preferences as well as a desired playlist time duration, and this application will create a spotify playlist customized for the user's needs. 
### App Evaluation
- **Category: Music/Social
- **Mobile: This app is suited for Mobile use since it generates playlists for users based on few of their preferences.
- **Story: Music plays such an important role in our lives, but with everyone's busy schedules, it can be difficult to find the time to create playlists and discover new music. With this app you can easily and quickly create and discover new playlists customized for you. 
- **Market: This app would be targeted towards music listeners, specifically spotify users. 
- **Habit: Users would open this app everytime they are in need for a new playlist to listen to, or if they want to see what their friends are listening to. 
- **Scope: This application would have the core feature of generating playlists based on a specified time duration and specified preferences of genres/artists. Since we can utilize the Spotify API, this would be doable in the duration of this program.
